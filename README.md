# Go-Code

A Go supporting compiler is required.

One method to run is

`go run ./file.go`

or you can compile with

`go build ./file.go`

then execute with

`./file`

## What helped me:

Knowing some basic C concepts helped a lot, since it has a C-like feel to it, while still being fun and easy to write

However here are some books and guides I used, referenced, and read.

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/go/index.htm
https://www.w3schools.com/go/index.php

Here are some places which also provide guides, some I haven't seen.

Hope this helps someone who is looking for some guides rather than non-explaining unhelpful links.

Also, sorry if you expected some video links, I learn by doing and reading.
